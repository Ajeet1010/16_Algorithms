*BL expectations from every engrs for the RFP program* -

1. Dedicate at least 8-10 hrs a day excluding the regular session and doubt session timing.
2. Go for proper knowledge and concepts understanding rather focussing on just completion of tasks.
3. Join doubt session regularly whether you are having doubt or not in order to learn from other's doubts.
4. Don't take unwanted leaves until and unless its an emergency.
5. Follow Git process and its programming religiously. All programs should be
in respective repos and branches with daily multi commits.
